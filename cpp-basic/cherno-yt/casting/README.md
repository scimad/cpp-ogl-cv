## Casting

### Types of casting

* static
* dynamic
* reinterpret cast
* const cast

#### Static Cast
* Can do implicit like conversions

#### Dynamic cast
* Used usually for downcasting (i.e. you have a Base Class pointer or reference and you want to cast it to more complex derived class.)

### Advantage of C++ style casts

* Compiletime checks
* Gives so much readibility
